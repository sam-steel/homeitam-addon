# HomeITAM

**Enterprise IT Asset Management (ITAM) for your Smart Home.**

HomeITAM is a self-hosted platform designed to solve the physical reality of managing a complex smart home. While dashboards like Home Assistant show you the *digital* state of your home, HomeITAM tracks the *physical* state: where devices are installed, how they are wired, when their batteries die, and what happens when the primary host fails.

## Features

- **The "Behind the Drywall" Problem:** Track exactly which junction box a relay is installed in, and upload pre-drywall framing photos so you never lose a wire again.
- **The "Dead Host" Problem:** Maintain a disaster recovery manual. If your primary server dies, HomeITAM stores the switch ports, VLAN tags, and Docker Compose snippets needed to rebuild from scratch.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Track battery levels, replacement dates, and warranty expirations across all your hardware.
- **Handover Protocol:** Generate a beautiful PDF export of your entire smart home infrastructure to hand over to a new buyer when you sell your house.
- **Secure by Design:** Built with AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data, JWT authentication, and runs locally.

## Licensing Model

HomeITAM operates on a freemium model:
- **Free Tier:** Manage up to 10 physical devices for free forever. Perfect for small setups or testing.
- **Pro Tier ($15 One-Time):** Unlock unlimited devices. No subscriptions, no recurring fees.

*License keys are managed securely via Lemon Squeezy.*
